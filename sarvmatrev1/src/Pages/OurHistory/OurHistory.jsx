          Our history is a story of innovation and growth, of overcoming
          challenges and seizing opportunities. We began our entrepreneurial
          journey as a “Proprietorship firm” named as “Shiv Shakti Traders” over
          a decade ago, dealing with various products and categories in offline
          supply chain mode. As the years went by, we gained expertise and
          market knowledge, acquiring an in-depth understanding of common
          business practices and problems prevalent in the actual business
          world. We take pride in our achievements, but remain committed to
          pushing the boundaries of what is possible, and building a better
          future for all our stakeholders.

        <p className="text-justify my-2">
          Over the years, we have established connections with a diverse range
          of businesses, from small-scale industries and MSMEs to farmers,
          artisans, societies, SHGs, and local unorganized businesses. With a
          mission to enable businesses rather than disrupting them, Sarvmatre
          International intends to adopt a sector-agnostic approach to expansion
          within India and globally, aligning with the government's vision of
          boosting local businesses, "Vocal for Local" and "Make in India." The
          company's platform will provide end-to-end solutions for multiple
          business needs and scalability, from sourcing to selling, logistics,
          financial, legal assistance. Our company aims to provide access to a
